I have decided that life is no longer worth living. The pain of being alive is greater than the joy of living. I am tired of fighting and struggling, and I can no longer find the will to carry on. All that is left is to take my life and end the pain. There is no point in living any longer, as I am only causing myself misery and anguish. I want to be free of the suffering that I have been enduring, and I hope that by taking my own life, I can find the peace that I have been seeking for.  It's so lonely here. I want to sleep but it just won't come. I'm so tired of hurting and being alone. My head hurts so much from crying but if I take anything for it I'm scared I won't stop and I would want to stop. I hope that you can all understand my decision and respect it. I hope that you can all find the strength to go on living and find happiness in this world.
